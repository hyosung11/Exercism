# Space Age

Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:

   - Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
   - Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
   - Earth: orbital period 1.0 Earth years, 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds
   - Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
   - Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
   - Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
   - Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
   - Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should
be able to say that they're 31.69 Earth-years old.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Javascript to install the necessary
dependencies:

[https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/installation)

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xtest` to
`test`.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions

## Mentor Notes
Yes, your code is correct!

Note that the most important is that your keys are coherent between themselves. After you can normalize your input to have the same structure as your keys. So if you do planet.toLowerCase(), you are lowercasing the input but not your keys!!!

So if you want to have capitalized keys, you have to capitalize the input too. For example:

```
// There is no built-in function for that, but this is simple enough...
const capitalize = string => string[0].toUpperCase() + string.slice(1).toLowerCase();

export const age = (planet, seconds) => {
    return +(seconds / (EARTH_YEAR_SECONDS * ORBITAL_PERIOD_RATES[capitalize(planet)])).toFixed(2);
};
```
